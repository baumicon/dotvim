### Installation

`git clone git://github.com/baumik/dotvim.git ~/.vim && ~/.vim/setup.sh`

You can also install `fonts/Inconsolata-g-Powerline.ttf` if you want fancy powerline symbols. If not you may want to disable fancy in your `.vimrc.local`.

Switched the Ack plugin to use [The Silver Searcher](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher)
Install OSX: `brew install the_silver_searcher`

For xmpfilter:
